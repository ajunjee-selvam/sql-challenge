# sql-challenge
This project is an example SQL analysis assignment where we are tasked as a new data engineer for Perlett-Hackard to design the tables to hold the employee data and answer questions about the data. 

## Steps Included
- data modelling and data engineering
    - creating a table schemata for each of the 6 csv files and importing the data into SQL 
- data analysis
    - generatiing queries in order to provide the requested info

## Technologies Used
- Postgres SQL
- QuickDBD

## 'EmployeeSQL' directory contents
- 'data' folder 
    - this contains the 6 csv files that were used to create the employee database in SQL
- QuickDBD-export-ERD Sketch
    - this is a sketch of the ERD from QuickDBD to define the relationships between the tables
- QuickDBD-export-ERD Schemata
    - this is the table schemata generated by QuickDBD based on the relationship sketch that was generated
- Table schemata
    - this is a copy of the table schemata that was exported from QuickDBD and imported into a SQL file
- Queries
    - this is the SQL file containing the answers to the queries


When running the table schemata to create the tables in SQL, please be sure to create the tables and then import the data in the correct order before executing the table alterations code from the table schemata to avoid any errors.
